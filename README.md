# üéØ Rug Or Moon

**A Revolutionary Web3 Prediction Game on Aptos Blockchain**

Unlike traditional "all-or-nothing" Web3 games, Rug Or Moon Game introduces **calculated risk mechanics** where players can strategically balance risk and reward based on their confidence level and market analysis.

---

## üéÆ **Game Overview**

Rug Or Moon Game is a blockchain-based prediction game where players bet on where a chart/price will end up within a grid of squares. What makes this unique is the **graduated risk-reward system** that eliminates the binary win/lose nature of traditional Web3 games.

### **Key Innovation: Calculated Risk, Not Gambling**

Instead of "bet everything and win/lose everything," our game uses sophisticated mathematical formulas that reward strategic thinking:

- **Select fewer squares** = Higher potential rewards but higher risk
- **Select more squares** = Lower risk but smaller potential rewards
- **Strategic distribution** = Must spread selections across all time periods (columns)

## üß† **How It Differs From Traditional Web3 Mine Games**

| **Traditional Mine Games**                                   | **Rug Or Moon**                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå **Binary Outcome**: Win all or lose all                   | ‚úÖ **Calculated Risk**: Graduated payouts based on coverage   |
| ‚ùå **Pure Luck**: Random mine placement                      | ‚úÖ **Skill-Based**: Strategic grid selection with constraints |
| ‚ùå **High Volatility**: Extreme swings                       | ‚úÖ **Controlled Risk**: Mathematical risk-reward curves       |
| ‚ùå **Simple Mechanics**: Just avoid mines                    | ‚úÖ **Strategic Depth**: Column requirements, 85% limits       |
| ‚ùå **Addiction Prone**: Encourages "just one more" mentality | ‚úÖ **Thoughtful Gaming**: Requires planning and analysis      |

## üéØ **Game Mechanics**

### **Risk-Reward Formula**

The game uses quadratic formulas to ensure fair and balanced outcomes:

**Winning Formula:**

```
Payout = ((1 - (selected_squares/total_squares))¬≤) √ó stake_amount
```

**Losing Formula:**

```
Loss = ((selected_squares/total_squares)¬≤) √ó stake_amount
```

### **Strategic Constraints**

1. **Column Requirement**: Must select at least one square in every column

   - Prevents players from ignoring time periods
   - Ensures engagement with chart movement prediction

2. **85% Selection Limit**: Cannot select more than 85% of total squares

   - Prevents "guaranteed win" scenarios
   - Maintains game balance and economics

3. **Multiple Difficulty Levels**:
   - **Level 1**: 6√ó3 grid (18 squares) - Larger squares, easier targeting
   - **Level 2**: 8√ó4 grid (32 squares) - Medium complexity
   - **Level 3**: 10√ó5 grid (50 squares) - Higher precision required
   - **Level 4**: 12√ó6 grid (72 squares) - Maximum difficulty

## üìä **Strategic Examples**

### **Conservative Strategy**

- Select 50-70% of squares
- **Lower Risk**: Small potential losses
- **Lower Reward**: Smaller potential gains
- **Best For**: Risk-averse players, beginners

### **Aggressive Strategy**

- Select 15-30% of squares
- **Higher Risk**: Larger potential losses
- **Higher Reward**: Significant potential gains
- **Best For**: Confident predictors, experienced players

### **Balanced Strategy**

- Select 30-50% of squares
- **Medium Risk**: Moderate potential losses
- **Medium Reward**: Decent potential gains
- **Best For**: Most players seeking balanced gameplay
